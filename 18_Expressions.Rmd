## Introduction

> To compute on the language, we first need to understand its structure.

* This requires a few things:
  * New vocabulary.
  * New tools to inspect and modify expressions.
  * Approach the use of the language with new ways of thinking.
* One of the first new ways of thinking is the distinction between an operation and its result.

```{r, error=TRUE}
y <- x * 10
```

* We can capture the intent of the code without executing it using the rlang package.

```{r}
z <- rlang::expr(y <- x * 10)

z
```

* We can then evaluate the expression using the **base::eval** function.

```{r}
x <- 4

base::eval(expr(y <- x * 10))

y
```

### Evaluating multiple expressions 

* We can write multiple expressions at once and it acts similar to `source()`.

* `expression()` returns a vector and can be passed to `eval()`.

```{r}
eval(expression(x <- 4, x * 10))
```

`exprs()` does not and has to be used in a loop

```{r}
for (i in exprs(x <- 4, x * 10)) {
print(i)
print(eval(i))
}
```

## Abstract Syntact Tree (AST)

* Expressions are objects that capture the structure of code without evaluating it.
* Expressions are also called abstract syntax trees (ASTs) because the structure of code is hierarchical and can be naturally represented as a tree. 
* Understanding this tree structure is crucial for inspecting and modifying expressions.
  * Branches = Calls
  * Leaves = Symbols and constants

```{r,eval=FALSE}
f(x, "y", 1)
```

### With `lobstr::ast():`

```{r}
lobstr::ast(f(x, "y", 1))
```

* Some functions might also contain more calls like the example below:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
f(g(1, 2), h(3, 4, i())):
```
![](images/complicated.png)

```{r}
lobstr::ast(f(g(1, 2), h(3, 4, i())))
```
* Read the **hand-drawn diagrams** from left-to-right (ignoring vertical position)
* Read the **lobstr-drawn diagrams** from top-to-bottom (ignoring horizontal position).
* The depth within the tree is determined by the nesting of function calls. 
* Depth also determines evaluation order, **as evaluation generally proceeds from deepest-to-shallowest, but this is not guaranteed because of lazy evaluation**.

##  Infix calls

> Every call in R can be written in tree form because any call can be written in prefix form.

```{r eval=FALSE}
y <- x * 10
`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10))
```

* Since this is a characteristic of the language, regardless if it's a function written in infix or prefix form, can be represented using an AST.

![](images/prefix.png)

```{r}
lobstr::ast(y <- x * 10)
```

```{r}
lobstr::ast(`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10)))
```

* There is no difference between the ASTs, and if you generate an expression with prefix calls, R will still print it in infix form:

```{r}
rlang::expr(`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10)))
```

## Expression components 

* Collectively, the data structures present in the AST are called expressions.

## Constants

* Scalar constants are the simplest component of the AST. 
* A constant is either **NULL** or a **length-1** atomic vector (or scalar) 
  * `TRUE`, `1L`, `2.5` or `x`. 
* We can test for a constant with **rlang::is_syntactic_literal()**.
* Constants are self-quoting in the sense that the expression used to represent a constant is the same constant:

```{r}
identical(expr(TRUE), TRUE)
```
```{r}
identical(expr(1), 1)
```
```{r}
identical(expr(2L), 2L)
```
```{r}
identical(expr("x"), "x")
```

## Symbols

* A symbol represents the name of an object.
  * `x`
  * `mtcars`
  * `mean`. 
* In base R, the terms symbol and name are used interchangeably (i.e. `is.name()` is identical to `is.symbol()`), but this book used symbol consistently because **“name”** has many other meanings.
* You can create a symbol in two ways: 
  1. by capturing code that references an object with `expr()`.
  2. turning a string into a symbol with `rlang::sym():`.

```{r}
expr(x)
```

```{r}
sym("x")
```

* A symbol can be turned back into a string with `as.character()` or `rlang::as_string()`. 
  `as_string()` has the advantage of clearly signalling that you’ll get a character vector of length 1.

```{r}
as_string(expr(x))
```

* We can recognise a symbol because it’s printed without quotes
* `str()` tells you that it’s a symbol, and `is.symbol()` is TRUE:

```{r}
str(expr(x))
```

```{r}
is.symbol(expr(x))
```

* The symbol type is not vectorised, i.e. a symbol is always length 1. 
* If you want multiple symbols, you’ll need to put them in a list, using `rlang::syms()`.

## Calls

* A call object represents a captured function call. 
* Call objects are a special type of list. 
  * The first component specifies the function to call (usually a symbol). 
  * The remaining elements are the arguments for that call. 
* Call objects create branches in the AST, because calls can be nested inside other calls.
* You can identify a call object when printed because it looks just like a function call. 
  * Confusingly `typeof()` and `str()` print language for call objects, but `is.call()` returns TRUE:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(read.table("important.csv", row.names = FALSE))
```

```{r}
x <- expr(read.table("important.csv", row.names = FALSE))
```

```{r}
typeof(x)
```

```{r}
is.call(x)
```

## Subsetting

* Calls generally behave like lists.
* Since they are lists, you can use standard subsetting tools. 
* The first element of the call object is the function to call, which is usually a symbol:

```{r}
x[[1]]
```

```{r}
is.symbol(x[[1]])
```
* The remainder of the elements are the arguments:

```{r}
as.list(x[-1])
```
* We can extract individual arguments with [[ or, if named, $:

```{r}
x[[2]]
```

```{r}
x$row.names
```

* We can determine the number of arguments in a call object by subtracting 1 from its length:

```{r}
length(x) - 1
```

* Extracting specific arguments from calls is challenging because of R’s flexible rules for argument matching:
  * It could potentially be in any location, with the full name, with an abbreviated name, or with no name. 

* To work around this problem, you can use **rlang::call_standardise()** which standardises all arguments to use the full name:

```{r}
rlang::call_standardise(x)
```

* But If the function uses ... it’s not possible to standardise all arguments.
* Calls can be modified in the same way as lists:

```{r}
x$header <- TRUE
x
```

## Function position

* The first element of the call object is the function position. This contains the function that will be called when the object is evaluated, and is usually a symbol.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(foo())
```

* While R allows you to surround the name of the function with quotes, the parser converts it to a symbol:

```{r}
lobstr::ast("foo"())
```

* However, sometimes the function doesn’t exist in the current environment and you need to do some computation to retrieve it: 
  * For example, if the function is in another package, is a method of an R6 object, or is created by a function factory. In this case, the function position will be occupied by another call:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(pkg::foo(1))
```

```{r}
lobstr::ast(obj$foo(1))
```

```{r}
lobstr::ast(foo(1)(2))
```

![](images/call-call.png)

## Constructing

* You can construct a call object from its components using rlang::call2(). 
* The first argument is the name of the function to call (either as a string, a symbol, or another call).
* The remaining arguments will be passed along to the call:

```{r}
call2("mean", x = expr(x), na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
call2(expr(base::mean), x = expr(x), na.rm = TRUE)
```
* Infix calls created in this way still print as usual.

```{r}
call2("<-", expr(x), 10)
```

**18.3.5 Exercises**

## Parsing and grammar

* **Parsing** - The process by which a computer language takes a string and constructs and expression. Parsing is governed by a set of rules known as a grammar. 
* We are going to use **lobstr::ast()** to explore some of the details of R’s grammar, and then show how you can transform back and forth between expressions and strings.
* **Operator precedence** - Conventions used by the programming language to resolve ambiguity.
* Infix functions introduce two sources of ambiguity.
* The first source of ambiguity arises from infix functions: what does 1 + 2 * 3 yield? Do you get 9 (i.e. (1 + 2) * 3), or 7 (i.e. 1 + (2 * 3))? In other words, which of the two possible parse trees below does R use?

![](images/ambig-order.png)

- Programming languages use conventions called operator precedence to resolve this ambiguity. We can use **ast()** to see what R does:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(1 + 2 * 3)
```
- Predicting the precedence of other operators is harder. There’s one particularly surprising case in R: ! has a much lower precedence (i.e. it binds less tightly) than you might expect. This allows you to write useful operations like:
```{r}
lobstr::ast(!x %in% y)
```
- **R has over 30 infix operators divided into 18 precedence** groups. While the details are described in **?Syntax**, very few people have memorised the complete ordering. If there’s any confusion, use parentheses!

**Associativity**
- The second source of ambiguity is introduced by repeated usage of the same infix function. For example, is 1 + 2 + 3 equivalent to **(1 + 2) + 3** or to **1 + (2 + 3)**? This normally doesn’t matter because **x + (y + z) == (x + y) + z**, i.e. addition is associative, but is needed because some S3 classes define + in a non-associative way.

- For example, ggplot2 overloads + to build up a complex plot from simple pieces; this is non-associative because earlier layers are drawn underneath later layers (i.e. **geom_point()** + **geom_smooth()** does not yield the same plot as **geom_smooth()** + **geom_point())**.

- In R, most operators are left-associative, i.e. the operations on the left are evaluated first:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(1 + 2 + 3)
```
 **Parsing and deparsing**
- Most of the time you type code into the console, and R takes care of turning the characters you’ve typed into an AST. But occasionally you have code stored in a string, and you want to parse it yourself. You can do so using **rlang::parse_expr()**:

```{r}
x1 <- "y <- x + 10"
x1
```
```{r}
is.call(x1)
```

```{r}
x2 <- rlang::parse_expr(x1)

x2

```

```{r}
is.call(x2)
```
- **parse_expr()** always returns a single expression. If you have multiple expression separated by ; or \n, you’ll need to use **rlang::parse_exprs()**. It returns a list of expressions:

```{r}
x3 <- "a <- 1; a + 1"
```
```{r}
rlang::parse_exprs(x3)
```
- If we find ourselve working with strings containing code very frequently, we should reconsider our process. We are going to address this in Chapter 19 where we are going to generate expressions using **quasiquotation** more safely.

- The inverse of parsing is deparsing: given an expression, you want the string that would generate it. This happens automatically when you print an expression, and you can get the string with **rlang::expr_text()**:
```{r}
z <- expr(y <- x + 10)
```
```{r}
expr_text(z)
```
 **18.4.4 Exercises**

##  Pairlists
- Pairlists are a remnant of R’s past and have been replaced by lists almost everywhere. The only place you are likely to see pairlists in R is when working with calls to the function, as the formal arguments to a function are stored in a pairlist:
```{r}
f <- expr(function(x, y = 10) x + y)
```
```{r}
args <- f[[2]]
args
```
```{r}
typeof(args)
```
- Fortunately, whenever you encounter a pairlist, you can treat it just like a regular list:

```{r}
pl <- pairlist(x = 1, y = 2)
```
```{r}
length(pl)
```
```{r}
pl$x
```
## Expression vectors
- an expression vector is just a list of expressions. The only difference is that calling eval() on an expression evaluates each individual expression. 

- Expression vectors are only produced by two base functions: expression() and parse():

```{r}
exp1 <- parse(text = c("
x <- 4
x
"))
```
```{r}
exp2 <- expression(x <- 4, x)
```

```{r}
typeof(exp1)
typeof(exp2)
```

```{r}
exp1
exp2
```
- Like calls and pairlists, expression vectors behave like lists:
```{r}
length(exp1)
exp1[[1]]
```
