- Observe ways to compose a function 
- Discuss the rules of lexical scoping
- Highlight the properties of lazy evaluation
- Overview the tools available to exit out of a function
- Overview the three forms used to compose functions 

## How to make a simple function in R

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
```

Let's imagine the structure of a function:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.cap="The black dot on the left is the environment. The two blocks to the right are the function arguments."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/06_functions.png")
```

**Function components**

Functions have three parts:

* `formals()`
* `body()`
* `environment()`.

```{r 06-c01, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.dim="100%"}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("
   graph LR
     A{formals}-->B(body)
     B-->C(environment)
style A fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
",height = '100%', width = '100%')
```

**Example**

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
coffee_ratings <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/coffee_ratings.csv')
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
coffee_ratings %>%
  slice(1:3) %>%
  select(1:5)
```

```{r, function_example}
avg_points <- function(species) {
  # this function is for calculating the mean
  avg <-  coffee_ratings %>%
  filter(species == species) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(total_cup_points))

  return(avg)
}
```

```{r}
avg_points("Arabica")
```

```{r}
formals(avg_points)
```

```{r}
body(avg_points)
```

```{r}
environment(avg_points)
```

* Functions uses attributes just like other objects.
* One attribute used by base R is `srcref`, short for **source reference**. 
* `srcref` points to the source code used to create the function. It contains code comments and other formatting.

```{r}
attr(avg_points, "srcref")
```

## Primitive functions

* Written in C code.
* Core functions in base R, such as `sum()`

```{r}
sum
```

Type of primitives:

- builtin 
- special

```{r}
typeof(sum)
typeof(`[`)
typeof(`<-`)
```

* Why is this important?
  * These core functions have components that return `NULL`.

```{r}
formals(sum)
body(sum)
environment(sum)
```

## First-class functions

* R functions are objects in their own right.
* No special syntax is required to define or name a function.
* Simply use the function `function`.
* Bind it to a name using `<-`.

```{r}
one <- function() {
  x <- 1
  return(x)
}

one()
```

## Anonymous functions

* Cases where you don't provide a name to a function.

```{r}
lapply(mtcars %>% select(mpg, cyl), function(x) length(unique(x)))
# As of 4.1.0
lapply(mtcars %>% select(mpg, cyl), \(x) length(unique(x)))
# Using a map function
map(mtcars, \(.x) print(max(.x)))
```

```{r}
vector_len <- function(x) {
  length(unique(x))
}
```

```{r}
lapply(mtcars %>% select(mpg, cyl), vector_len)
```

* Functions in a list.

```{r}
funs <- list(
  bar = function(x) ggplot(x, aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_col(),
  point = function(x) ggplot(x, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point()
)
funs$point(mtcars)
funs$bar(mtcars)
```

## Invoking a function

* Most likely we're familiar with the following form:

```{r}
runif(1:10, 0, 100)
```

* Less familiar, arguments in a data structure.
* Not sure why you would do this, though?

```{r}
args <- list(1:10, min = 0, max = 100)

do.call(runif, args)
```

## Function composition

* Nest the function calls:
  * Good for simple code 
  * Becomes hard to read when nesting is complex

```{r}
square <- function(x) x^2
deviation <- function(x) x - mean(x)
x <- runif(100)
sqrt(mean(square(deviation(x))))
```

* Save the intermediate results as variables:
  * You have to name each step
  * Clutters up the environment with objects

```{r}
out <- deviation(x)
out <- square(out)
out <- mean(out)
out <- sqrt(out)
out
```

* Piping
  * Easier to read
  * Only applicable when you have linear sequences or transformations

```{r}
x %>%
  deviation() %>%
  square() %>%
  mean() %>%
  sqrt()

# As of 4.1.0
x |>
  deviation() |>
  square() |>
  mean() |>
  sqrt()
```

## More about functions insights

### Lexical scoping

> Scope refers to the places in a program where a variable is visible and can be referenced. 
> - From Ming-Ho Yee [here](https://prl.ccs.neu.edu/blog/2019/09/05/lexical-and-dynamic-scope/)

> Lexical scoping, the scope of a variable is determined by the lexical (i.e., textual) structure of a program.
> - From Ming-Ho Yee [here](https://prl.ccs.neu.edu/blog/2019/09/05/lexical-and-dynamic-scope/)

**Rules**

* Name masking - names defined in a function mask names defined outside a function.
* Functions versus variables - name masking also applies to functions
* A fresh start - each execution of the function creates a new environment. Functions are not smart enough to know what happened in the past.
* Dynamic lookup - R looks for values when the function is run, not when the function is created.

* Example taken from blog posts linked above:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 1
f <- function() x
g <- function() {
  x <- 2
  f()
}
g() # what does this return?
```

**Debugging**

* This function 

```{r}
g12 <- function() x + 1
x <- 15
g12()
```

```{r}
codetools::findGlobals(g12)
```

* You can change the function’s environment to an environment which contains nothing:

```{r}
environment(g12) <- emptyenv()
g12()
```

## Lazy evaluation

* Function arguments only evaluate if accessed.

```{r}
h01 <- function(x) {
  10
}

h01(stop("This is an error!"))
```

* Lazy evaluation is powered by a data structure called a promise.
* Lazy evaluation allows for functions to have default arguments.
* Lazy evaluation provides flexibility to create functions that have long running computations.

```{r}
h04 <- function(x = 1, y = x * 2, z = a + b) {
  a <- 10
  b <- 100

  c(x, y, z)
}

h04()
```

* The book suggests not doing this, even though some base R functions do.

## ... (dot-dot-dot)

* General example

```{r}
i01 <- function(y, z) {
  list(y = y, z = z)
}

i02 <- function(x, ...) {
  i01(...)
}

str(i02(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3))
#> List of 2
#>  $ y: num 2
#>  $ z: num 3
```

* Applied example

```{r}
scatter_plot <- function(...) {
  ggplot(mtcars, aes(...)) +
    geom_point()
}

scatter_plot(y = mpg, x = wt)
scatter_plot(y = mpg, x = disp)
```

* There's additional uses of the `...`
  1. If your function takes a function as an argument, you'll want some way to pass additional arguments to that function.
  2. If your function is an S3 generic, you need some way to all methods to take arbitrary extra arguments.
* The book mentions we'll come back to these topics, so not much else on it for now.

* Downsides to using the `...`
  1. When used to pass arguments to other functions, you have to explain to the user where they go.
  2. A misspelled argument will not raise an error.

```{r}
# Misspelling does not result in an error
sum(1, 2, NA, na_rm = TRUE)
```

## Exiting a function

1. Implicit or explicit returns.

2. Invisibility (`<-` most famous function that returns an invisible value).

3. `stop()` to stop a function with an error.

4. Exit handlers.

## Implicit vs. Explicit

* Implicit return: the last value from the function is returned

```{r}
j01 <- function(x) {
  if (x < 10) {
    0
  } else {
    10
  }
}
j01(5)
j01(15)
```

* Explicit: use the `return()` function to explicitly return a value

```{r}
j02 <- function(x) {
  if (x < 10) {
    return(0)
  } else {
    return(10)
  }
}
j02(5)
j02(15)
```

## Invisible values

* Most functions will print the result of a function (visible).
* Prevent this printing by applying `invisible`.

```{r}
j04 <- function() invisible(1)
j04()
# to verify it works
str(withVisible(j04()))
```

* Most common invisible function is the `<-`.
* This characteristic makes it possible to chain assignments.

```{r}
a <- b <- c <- d <- 2
```

## Errors

* Most of us have seen and worked with errors before. 
* `stop()` can be used to immediately terminate execution in the case of a failed state.
* An error should communicate there is a problem that the user needs to fix.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
j05 <- function() {
  stop("I'm an error")
  return(10)
}
j05()
```

## Exit handlers

* Sometimes functions need to make temporary changes to the global state.
* Functions should always clean up after themselves.
* This is where `on.exit()` comes into play.
* Exit handlers will run regardless of whether the function exits normally or with an error.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
j06 <- function(x) {
  cat("Hello\n")
  on.exit(cat("Goodbye!\n"), add = TRUE)
  
  if (x) {
    return(10)
  } else {
    stop("Error")
  }
}

j06(TRUE)
# Hello
# Goodbye!
# [1] 10

j06(FALSE)
# Hello
# Error in j06(FALSE) : Error
# Goodbye!
```

* `on.exit()` is useful when we need to clean up after a function run.

```{r}
cleanup <- function(dir, code) {
  old_dir <- setwd(dir)
  on.exit(setwd(old_dir), add = TRUE)

  old_opt <- options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  on.exit(options(old_opt), add = TRUE)
}
```

## Function forms

> Everything that exists is an object.

> Everything that happens is a function call.

> — John Chambers


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/06_forms.png")
```

> An interesting property of R is that every infix, replacement, or special form can be rewritten in prefix form.

* A few simple examples:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# infix
x + y
# prefix
`+`(x, y)

# replacement
names(df) <- c("x", "y", "z")
# prefix
`names<-`(df, c("x", "y", "z"))

# special
for (i in 1:10) print(i)
# prefix
`for`(i, 1:10, print(i))
```

## Prefix form

* Most common function form used in R.
* Prefix is special because you can specify arguments in three ways:
  1. By position, `help(mean)`
  2. Partial matching, `help(top = mean)`
  3. By name, `help(topic = mean)`
* Some rules to follow:
  1. Use positional matching for the first one or two arguments.
  2. Avoid positional matching for less commonly used arguments.
  3. Never use partial matching.

## Infix form

* Gets its name because the function goes between the arguments.
* Another way to think about it, `a func b`.
* R has a bunch of built-in infix operators.
* We can define our own:

```{r}
`%+%` <- function(a, b) paste0(a, b)
"new" %+% "string"
```

* Examples from Colin Fay in the blog post [here](https://colinfay.me/playing-r-infix-functions/#:~:text=What%20are%20infix%20functions%3F,%2C%20%2B%20%2C%20and%20so%20on.).

```{r}
1:10
`:`(1,10)
2+3
`+`(2,3)
```

* You have total freedom to redefine any infix functions:

```{r}
# Warning : don't try this at home
`+` <- function(a,b){a*b}
2 + 10

`<-` <- .Primitive("+")
2 <- 3

# Restore cosmic ordeR
`<-` = .Primitive("<-")
`+` <- .Primitive("+")
```

* You can use any character between the `%`, even emojis.

```{r}
`%🍕%` <- dplyr::slice
iris %🍕% 2
```

## Replacement functions

* Act like they modify their arguments in place.
* Have the special name `xxx<-`.
* Must have arguments `x` and `value`.
* Must return the modified object.

```{r}
`second<-` <- function(x, value) {
  x[2] <- value
  x
}
```

* Are used by placing the function call on the left side of `<-`.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
second(x) <- 5L
x
second(x) <- 10L
x
```

## Special forms

* The definition of parentheses (see `?`(``)
* Subsetting operators (see `?`[[``)
* Tools used in control flow (see `?`if``)
* Definition of `function` (see `?`function``)

## Case Study: SIR model function

This is an interesting example taken from a course on Coursera: [Infectious disease modelling-ICL](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/infectious-disease-modelling)

The purpose of this example is to show how to make a model passing through making a function.

First we need to load some useful libraries:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(deSolve)
library(reshape2)
```


Then set the model inputs:

- population size (N)
- number of susceptable (S)
- infected (I)
- recovered (R)

And add the model parameters:

- infection rate ($\beta$)
- recovery rate ($\gamma$)


```{r}
N<- 100000                  # population

state_values<- c(S = N -1,   # susceptible
                 I = 1,      # infected
                 R = 0)      # recovered

parameters<- c(beta = 1/2,  # infection rate days^-1
               gamma = 1/4) # recovery rate days^-1
```


Then we set the **time** as an important factor, which defines the length of time we are looking at this model run. It is intended as the time range in which the infections spread out, let’s say that we are aiming to investigate an infection period of 100 days.

```{r}
times<- seq(0, 100, by = 1)
```

Finally, we set up the **SIR model**, the susceptable, infected and recovered model. How do we do that is passing the paramenters through a function of the time, and state.

Within the model function we calculate one more paramenter, the **force of infection**: $\lambda$ 

```{r}
sir_model<- function(time, state, parameters){
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)),{
    N<- S + I + R
    lambda = beta * I/N    # force of infection
    dS<- - lambda * S 
    dI<- lambda * S - gamma * I
    dR<- gamma * I
    return(list(c(dS,dI,dR)))
  })
}
```


Once we have our **SIR model** function ready, we can calculate the **output** of the model, with the help of the function `ode()` from {deSolve} package.

```{r}
output<- as.data.frame(ode(y = state_values,
                           times = times,
                           func = sir_model,
                           parms = parameters))
output %>% head
```

In addition to our builtin SIR model function we can have a look at:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=T}
?deSolve::ode()
```

It solves **Ordinary Differential Equations**. 

```{r}
deSolve:::ode
```

```{r}
methods("ode")
```


---

With the help of the {reshape2} package we use the function `melt()` to reshape the output:

```{r}
melt(output,id="time") %>% head
```


The same as usign `pivot_longer()` function.
```{r}
output%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("S","I","R"),
               names_to="variable",
               values_to="values") %>%
  arrange(desc(variable)) %>%
  head
```

---


Before to proceed with the visualization of the SIR model output we do a bit of investigations.

**What if we want to see how `melt()` function works?**

**What instruments we can use to see inside the function and understand how it works?**


Using just the function name **melt** or `structure()` function with *melt* as an argument, we obtain the same output. To select just the argument of the function we can do `args(melt)`

```{r}
reshape2:::melt
```


```{r}
body(melt)
```

```{r}
formals(melt)
```

```{r}
environment(melt)
```


```{r}
typeof(melt)
```

> "R functions simulate a closure by keeping an explicit reference to the environment that was active when the function was defined."


ref: [closures](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2015/03/using-closures-as-objects-in-r/)



Try with `methods()`, or `print(methods(melt))`: Non-visible functions are asterisked!

> The S3 method name is followed by an asterisk * if the method definition is not exported from the package namespace in which the method is defined.

```{r}
methods("melt", data)
```

```{r}
methods(class="table")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=T}
help(UseMethod)
```


We can access to some of the above calls with `getAnywhere()`, for example here is done for "melt.data.frame":
```{r}
getAnywhere("melt.data.frame")
```

Going back to out model output visualization.

```{r}
output_full<- melt(output,id="time")
```

```{r}
output_full$proportion<- output_full$value/sum(state_values)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = output, aes(x = time, y = I)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlab("Time(days)") +
  ylab("Number of Infected") + 
  labs("SIR Model: prevalence of infection")
```

```{r}
ggplot(output_full, aes(time, proportion, color = variable, group = variable)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlab("Time(days)") +
  ylab("Prevalence") + 
  labs(color = "Compartment", title = "SIR Model")
```
